*   Multiplayer
*   Cooperation
*   Competition


## Earth sim type game


### Ideas



    *   Generic earth-like world
    *   Competition: different nations
        *   Working towards defending against an impending asteroid attack
        *   Building missiles to intercept asteroids
        *   Nation with the most powerful defense, who contributes most towards stopping the asteroids wins/nation with the most resources wins.
        *   You all lose if the asteroids get through
        *   The worlds most basic AI
        *   If everyone has a shield, the asteroid doesn’t end the game
            *   Shields defend an area of the world’s surface
            *   You can give shields to another country
        *   If you shoot down the asteroid, you get points
        *   Request for resources
        *   Research detection
            *   Know when asteroids are going to hit
            *   Higher level detection means you have more time to prepare
    *   Cooperation: defend earth from asteroids/climate change/aliens etc etc
        *   Any generic global threat
    *   Research/Share technology
    *   Topdown map view/3D globe
    *   Buildings
        *   Each building has an area it takes up
        *   Maps have areas where buildings can be placed or not
    *   Trade
    *   Realtime Strategy?
    *   Turn-based Strategy?
    *   Loss = your nation is one of the weakest, bigger loss = the world gets destroyed by the main threat.
    *   Strength = overall presence in the world. (missile bases are used to shoot down asteroids, but also increase strength)
    *   3D earth, rotate and select country
        *   Or a 2D map, scroll left/right/up/down
    *   First City - Main city of the game
        *   Winner conquers/influences first city
    *   Different countries have different needs
        *   China needs solar energy, so you design solar energy
            *   Good at hydro because they have the biggest dam
        *   South america needs farms
            *   Good at solar due to lots of sun
        *   Each country has a specific tech tree, you cannot learn some techs without getting them from other countries \

    *   Asteroid waves coming, different amounts targeting different areas
        *   Need shields and weapons. If one country dies you all lose
        *   The more you shoot, the more points. And u win.
        *   Each country can survive a certain number of hits
        *   If any country falls, everyone loses


### Overview

You are leading a nation and helping to defend the world against waves of asteroids. You must build factories and power plants to supply your nation with resources and energy. You must research new technologies to defend your country and the world against the asteroids. You must share research, resources, and defense with other countries to protect them. The nation that builds the most successful asteroid defense, wins. If any nation falls, we all lose.


### // Idea: Nations aren’t limited by research available, they are limited by starting resources.


### Questions to Answer



*   Map View style
*   Hotseat/turnbased/realtime? How do we do networking?
*   UIs for displaying resources/score
*   How do we score players?
*   How do you win?
*   What events threaten the world?
*   How do we display information to user \



### Game Pieces


#### Defenses



*   Missiles - require resources to build, and also require resources to make the missles
*   Lasers - require resources to build, just require energy to fire
*   Shields - constant energy cost


#### Buildings (to manage the economy)



*   Mines - produce resources (possibly need specific tiles to be built)
*   Power Plants - produce energy
*   Science Facilities - perform research, generate science points


#### Tech Tree



*   Technologies
    *   Cost (science points)
*   Unlock better tiers for:
    *   mines
    *   power plants
    *   science facilities
    *   Shields
    *   Missiles
    *   Lasers
    *   Radars - for detecting asteroids (version 2)


#### Scoring System (points awarded for)



*   Research
*   Sharing
*   Defending an asteroid wave
*   Building anything


#### Diplomacy



*   Give/Request
    *   Shields
    *   Missiles
    *   Tech


#### World Map



*   Nation boundaries
*   Nation names
*   Scores
*   Resource tiles?
*   Structures?


#### Nation



*   What radar level
*   What research is researched
*   Current number of mines, factories and powerplants
*   Score
*   Leaderboard screen to display


#### Asteroids



*   Waves
*   Each asteroid randomly targets a place on the world
*   Each player knows where the asteroids will hit based on their radar tech level
    *   First level you know 2 turns in advance
    *   Second level you know 5 turns in advance
    *   Third level you know where it will hit and can intercept


### Game Mechanics

We will have a handrawn map with a tile based grid.


#### Tiles



*   Each tile can have one type of building built on it
*   Click a tile, choose what to build
*   Buildings take resources
*   Each tile can also have a shield built on it
    *   Shield has a radius
*   Break buildings for limited resources, rebuild them
*   


### Minimum Viable Game



*   Map View
*   Choose your country
*   Research Tree
*   Resource Types
*   Factories/Mines/Science Facilities
*   Defense Buildings (missiles, shields)
*   Asteroid Event
*   Diplomacy (share tech, share resources)

		



*   **Cooperative game where competing for points**
    *   Like mario
    *   Like fireboy and watergirl
    *   Both need to work together to win a level but whoever gets more points (somehow) is 1st place
    *   Puzzles require multi-player
        *   Circuit puzzles?
        *   Each player has a collection of parts, puzzles require you to share pieces
*   Wait staff competing for tips
    *   Bonuses for helping other people out
        *   Makes customers happy
*   Pit crew at FRC competition
    *   Repair ur robot to keep it running
        *   Goes to competition, comes back broken
    *   Send ppl out to other people’s pits and give them parts
    *   Trade for parts
