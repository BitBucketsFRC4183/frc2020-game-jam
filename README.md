# Asteroid Apocalypse

You are leading a nation and helping to defend the world against waves of asteroids. You must build factories and power plants to supply your nation with resources and energy. You must research new technologies to defend your country and the world against the asteroids. You must share research, resources, and defense with other countries to protect them. The nation that builds the most successful asteroid defense wins. If any nation falls, we all lose.
