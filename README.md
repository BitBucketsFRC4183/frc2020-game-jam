# Asteroid Apocalypse

You are leading a nation and helping to defend the world against waves of asteroids. You must build mines and power plants to supply your nation with resources and power cells. You must research new technologies to defend your country and the world against the asteroids. You must share science, resources, and power cells with other countries to protect them. The nation that builds the most successful asteroid defense wins. If any nation falls, we all lose.

## Coopertition

The goal of Asteroid Apocalypse is to get the highest score while protecting your nation from falling asteroids. If any nation loses all of their territories, the game is over for everyone. You can only with if you all make it through the asteroid waves. You can help out your fellow nations by gifting them resources if an asteroid has targetted their territory and they haven't been able to build enough shields or lasers yet. The more you give, the more your score goes up, so be generous!

See if you and you friends can make it to the end! Good luck!

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mine        | Produces 1 unit raw resources per day                 | Produces 2 units of raw resources per day              | Produces 3 units of raw resources per day             |
| Power Plant | Produces 1 power cell per day                         | Produces 2 power cells per day                         | Produces 3 power cells per day                        |

| Shield      | Protects against one small asteroid before going down | Protects against one medium asteroid before going down | Protects against one large asteroid before going down |
| Laser       | Shoots at incoming asteroids                          | Increased range                                        | Increased range and slightly increased damage         |

## Important Mechanics

- Mines, Power Plants and Labs can only be placed on lightly colored "Resource Tiles"
- Lasers and Shields cannot be placed on Resource Tiles
- Asteroids never target the ocean
- There's a small circle around each building
- In the bottom right you'll see the other players and their resources, clicking on one of the miniature resource icons will give that player 1 of that resource. If you hold shift or control you will give 10 or 100 resources respectively.

## A Decent Strategy

1. Spend all starting materials on 3 mines and a power plant
2. Build a shield
3. Build a couple more mines, and another power plant
4. Build a laser
5. Build a couple labs
6. Improve economy when low on resources from now on
7. Build another shield
8. Keep building lasers (and the occasional shield) whenever possible
